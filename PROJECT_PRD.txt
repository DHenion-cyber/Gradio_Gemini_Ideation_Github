PRD – PHASE-AWARE COACHING CHATBOT
───────────────────────────────────
FILE NAME: PROJECT_PRD.txt (owner: Dale Henion)

PURPOSE & VISION

A single-page Streamlit chatbot that guides students through six digital-innovation topics (Value Proposition, Market Analysis, Business Model, Planning Growth, Beta Testing, Pitch Prep).

At any moment the user sees one focused question; the bot mediates answers with a domain-specific persona and moves the student through clearly-named phases.

IN-SCOPE (v1)

Interactive workflows for Value Proposition (fully working), plus skeletons for the other five topics.

Shared “Summary” and “Iteration” phases reused across all workflows.

Coach personas that validate, probe, and summarise within their domain.

Session state stored in Streamlit st.session_state; persistent session archive via SQLite/jsonl (basic).

Flat analytics log (JSON Lines) with workflow, phase, event, utc_ts.

OUT-OF-SCOPE (v1)

Multi-user authentication, fine-grained role management.

External CMS integrations, advanced UI theming, or heavy BI dashboards.

Full automated test coverage (will arrive after stability).

PRIMARY PERSONAS & USER STORIES

Student: “I choose a topic, answer questions, and receive tailored guidance without the bot losing track.”

Instructor: “I can inspect logs to see where students struggle.”

Developer (you/Roo): “I can add a new workflow by copying a folder template and writing PhaseEngine subclasses.”

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (STABILITY CHECKLIST)

Dynamic workflow menu shows all topics; selecting one resets state and lists its phases in the sidebar.

Each PhaseEngine:

accepts free-text, classifies intent (affirm, negative, ask_suggestion, unclear);

calls its CoachPersona methods;

marks itself complete or asks a clarifying question.

Persona replies differ by workflow and phase.

UI always displays banner “🧠 Workflow X | Phase Y | Waiting/User Input/System Thinking”.

On unexpected input the bot responds politely, never stalls.

Summary and Iteration phases are imported, not duplicated.

ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS (ADR-LITE)

PhaseEngineBase (new) implements core behaviour, logging, and intent parsing.

CoachPersonaBase (new) holds common helper methods.

Folder per workflow: workflows/value_prop/, workflows/market_analysis/, … each with persona.py, phases/.

Scratchpad keys prefixed with workflow slug to avoid collisions (vp_problem, ma_tam).

Analytics via log_event(event, **kv) in a shared analytics.py.

SUCCESS METRICS (MANUAL QA FOR v1)

100 % of manual test runs transition through every Value-Prop phase without crashing or echoing nonsense.

Instructor rates bot helpfulness ≥ 4 / 5 in a 5-run sample.

RISKS & MITIGATIONS

Silent failure loops → mitigated by debug banner + log_event.

Scope creep → mitigated by this PRD and milestone roadmap.

LLM latency → keep one question per round; no multi-shot prompts.
